                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
                    Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.

                    From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, 
                    the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

                    When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. 
                    At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. 
                    Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.
